| Pandora's Box Multimedia Interface |
+------------------------------------#

Pandora's Box is a new electronic musical instrument,
with the aim of blurring the lines of the flow of
information between people and electronics.

It is a modular hardware platform which can be
physically reconfigured, and it is built to be
compatible with commonly used hobbyist microcontroller
platforms, allowing straightforward user-customisation
of its functions.

It is currently in an initial prototyping stage,
with the hope that, once complete, all the design
information needed to build one will be released
under open source and open hardware licenses.
