| Pandora's Box Multimedia Interface |
+------------------------------------#

Pandora's Box is a new electronic musical instrument,
with the aim of blurring the lines of the flow of
information between people and electronics.

It is a modular hardware platform which can be
physically reconfigured, and it is built to be
compatible with commonly used hobbyist microcontroller
platforms, allowing straightforward user-customisation
of its functions.
